To promote open research of large models in the African NLP community, this project has open-sourced the **Yoruba LLaMA model and the Alpaca large model with instruction fine-tuning**. These models expand the Yoruba vocabulary based on the original LLaMA and use Yoruba data for secondary pre-training, further enhancing Yoruba basic semantic understanding. Additionally, the project uses Yoruba instruction data for fine-tuning on the basis of the Yoruba LLaMA, significantly improving the model's understanding and execution of instructions.

**Note:** The project implementation began on 22nd April, 2024. Please bearer with me as i bring it to life. Feel free to email me at ebartile@gmail.com

## Limitations

Although the model in this project may significantly improved Yoruba understanding and generation capabilities compared to the original LLaMA and Alpaca, there are also the following limitations:

- It may produce unpredictable harmful content and content that does not conform to human preferences and values.
- Due to computing power and data issues, the training of the related models may not be sufficient, and the Yoruba understanding ability needs to be further improved.
- There is no online interactive demo available for now (Note: users will still be able to deploy it locally themselves).
